### **Project Exercise 22: Movie Card Styling in React**

- **Topic Covered:** React, CSS, TailwindCSS, Animation
- **Description:** Create a movie card component in React that displays movie information such as title, image, description, and rating. Style the card using inline styles and CSS modules. Integrate `TailwindCSS` to style elements like buttons and headers, and apply responsive design with media queries. Use conditional styling based on the `movie's rating` (e.g., change color or style for high vs. low ratings). Add an animated hover effect to the movie card using Framer Motion or GSAP for enhanced interactivity.
