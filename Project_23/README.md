### **Project Exercise 23: Movie List with State and Props**

- **Topic Covered:** React, State, Props
- **Description:** Create a functional component that receives data via props and displays it. Use the `useState` hook to manage and update the component's state dynamically. Render a list of movies or items using the `map()` method and allow for updates to the list through state changes. Create parameterized components that accept dynamic props, and implement event handling for interactions like button clicks or form submissions.
- **Skills Covered:** State management with `useState`, passing data via props, rendering dynamic lists with `map()`, parameterized components, event handling in React.
